# STK500
STK500 (Arduino version) protocol support for Arduino.

Useful for flashing one Arduino from another.
Originally from BootDrive, which is BaldWisdom's port of avrdude (https://github.com/osbock/Baldwisdom/tree/master/BootDrive).  I added modifications so this works from an ESP8266 running Arduino code.
